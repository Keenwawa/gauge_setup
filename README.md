# Gauge Setup

For projects don't already have integration tests, this repository can be use to plug in the basic structure that we use for integration tests into that project.

To add this to your project, simply run `python manage.py startapp --template=https://github.com/Keenwawa/gauge_setup/archive/master.zip gauge`

Then edit the integration tests to fit your project.
